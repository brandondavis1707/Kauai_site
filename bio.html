            My name is Brandon Davis. I’m an Information Technology major at Arizona State University. I'm also
            pursuing an accelerated master’s in Information Security. This site was built as part of
            my coursework for IFT 301 to demonstrate front-end layout, styling, and usability.
          </p>

            I love watching sports. Primarily football, but I like to golf whenever I can. I also enjoy 
			traveling and exploring nature. My favorite place to visit is Hawaiʻi, specifically Kauaʻi, 
			an adventurer's paradise.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everything on this site was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following course
            guidelines, some prior knowledge, and best practices learned throughout the semester.
